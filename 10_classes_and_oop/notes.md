# 4 pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

## Abstraction

    Abstraction is one of the core principle of Object Oriented Programming(OOP). It means hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features of an object or function.

## Encapsulation

    Encapsulation is the OOP principle of bundling data(proprties) and methods(functions) that operate on that data into a single unit and restricting direct access to some of the objects component.

## Inheritance

    Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class (child) inherits properties and methods from another class (parent). This helps reuse code, reduce duplication, and create a hierarchy of objects.

## Polymorphism

    Polymorphism means "many forms". In programming, it allows the same function or method name to behave differently depending on the object calling it or the context.
